# 1st Project -  CREDIT CARD RISK ASSESSMENT
- ## Introduction to Credit Card Risk Assessment: ##
- The project focuses on implementing a machine learning model for credit card risk assessment, particularly using a dataset from a Kaggle competition.
- **Dataset Overview**: The dataset includes various features such as ID, credit limit, balance, education, marital status, age, and a crucial dependent feature indicating whether a person will default on their credit card payment the following month.
- **Data Preprocessing**: To emphasize the importance of data preprocessing, including dropping unnecessary columns like the ID, which serves only as a unique identifier.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: The presenter applies several machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost and Random Forest, to predict defaults. We note that XGBoost yielded better accuracy compared to Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: this project discusses the evaluation of the models and their performance metrics, highlighting the significance of selecting appropriate algorithms for better predictive accuracy.
- **Conclusion**: This project serves as a practical guide for implementing machine learning in financial risk assessment, showcasing how data-driven approaches can enhance credit risk management.

This summary encapsulates the key points of this project, providing a concise overview of the methodology and findings related to credit card risk assessment using machine learning.


# 2nd Project - Credit Risk Analysis for extending Bank Loans

## Summary: ##
This machine learning project predicts credit risk by analyzing a dataset of credit analysis factors.

## Key Steps:

- Data loading and cleaning: 
Imported the dataset and removed null values from the "default" column.
- Data analysis: 
Visualized the relationship between age and debt-to-income ratio, and age and income, using line charts.
- Model creation:
Created machine learning models using Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.
- Model evaluation: 
Used cross-validation to determine optimal SVM parameters and achieved an accuracy of 82%.
Achieved an accuracy of 83% with Logistic Regression.
Confusion matrix and heat map visualization:
Created a confusion matrix and heat map to analyze model performance, identifying potential areas for improvement.
